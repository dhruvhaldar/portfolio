## Design Systems

Design systems are crucial for maintaining consistency across large applications. They define the color palette, typography, spacing, and component libraries used throughout the project.

### Key Benefits

1.  **Consistency**: Ensures a uniform look and feel.
2.  **Efficiency**: Reusable components speed up development.
3.  **Scalability**: Easier to manage as the team and project grow.

## Layouts

Creating flexible layouts is easier with modern CSS tools like Flexbox and Grid.

<CodeBlock
  marginBottom="16"
  codeInstances={[
    {
      code: `.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr));
  gap: 1rem;
}`,
      language: "css",
      label: "styles.css",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Final Thoughts

Good design is invisible. It works so well that the user doesn't even notice it.
