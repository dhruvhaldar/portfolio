## Overview

The study evaluates an active space debris removal mission to ensure sustainable use of Earth's orbit. The mission proposes deploying a spacecraft equipped with net capture and drag sail technology to remove six spent rocket stages within a year. Simulations suggest that this approach is technically feasible with current technology, requiring approximately 301 operational days.

## Key Features

- **Net Capture and Drag Sail Deorbiting:** A spacecraft equipped with net-based debris capture and deployable sails to increase atmospheric drag.
- **Targeted Debris Removal:** Selection of six spent rocket bodies from the Thor Burner 2 program, optimizing orbital maneuvers.
- **Feasibility Analysis:** Assessment of time, cost, and technical constraints.
- **Environmental Considerations:** Evaluation of the mission's carbon footprint and impact on the atmosphere.

## Technologies Used

- **Net Capture Mechanism:** A spring-loaded net system designed to enclose debris and attach a drag sail.
- **Ion Propulsion System:** Low-thrust, high-efficiency propulsion for orbital maneuvers.
- **[Falcon 9 FT Launch Vehicle](https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/falcon-9/) :** Selected for cost-effective and reliable deployment.
- **MATLAB and Simulation Tools:** Used for trajectory and cost analysis.

## Challenges and Learnings

- **Orbital Maneuver Complexity:** Coordinating rendezvous with multiple debris objects within the mission timeline.
- **Cost and Scalability:** The estimated mission cost of $192M, excluding research and testing, highlights financial challenges.
- **Environmental Concerns:** While the carbon footprint of the mission is low compared to aviation, the long-term impact of increased rocket launches on the atmosphere requires further study.

## Outcome

The research concludes that active space debris removal is feasible using current technology. The mission design demonstrates that a single spacecraft can effectively remove multiple debris objects within a year. However, further research is needed to refine cost efficiencies and assess long-term sustainability. Future work includes improving net deployment precision, optimizing sail design, and evaluating alternative deorbiting methods.
