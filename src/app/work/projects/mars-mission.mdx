## Overview

The Olympus Mons Ascension Mission is a conceptual study exploring a crewed ascent of the tallest volcano in the Solar System. The mission is planned for 2043, with the goal of being the first human expedition to summit Olympus Mons. The project is divided into five main subgroups: Overall Coordination, Mission Design, Human Aspects, Mars Operations, and Space Vehicles. A budget of 37.49 billion USD has been estimated, with financial, logistical, and technical challenges addressed.

## Key Features

- **Mission to Summit Olympus Mons:** A three-person astronaut crew will attempt the climb after landing on Mars.
- **Multi-Phase Mars Operations:** Includes habitat setup, acclimatization, and final ascent strategy.
- **Risk and Safety Management:** Extensive planning to mitigate health risks and mission hazards.
- **Interplanetary Trajectory and Logistics:** Analysis of fuel, spacecraft, and landing approach.

## Technologies Used

- **SPICE System:** NASA-developed kernel for solar system positioning and trajectory calculation.
- **MATLAB Simulations:** Used for mission cost estimation and trajectory optimization.
- **Advanced Space Suits:** Designed to sustain astronauts in Mars' harsh environment.
- **Pressurized Rover:** Provides mobility for astronauts during the mission.
