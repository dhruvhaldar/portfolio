- **Mission to Summit Olympus Mons:** A three-person astronaut crew will attempt the climb after landing on Mars.
- **Multi-Phase Mars Operations:** Includes habitat setup, acclimatization, and final ascent strategy.
- **Risk and Safety Management:** Extensive planning to mitigate health risks and mission hazards.
- **Interplanetary Trajectory and Logistics:** Analysis of fuel, spacecraft, and landing approach.

## Technologies Used

- **SPICE System:** NASA-developed kernel for solar system positioning and trajectory calculation.
- **MATLAB Simulations:** Used for mission cost estimation and trajectory optimization.
- **Advanced Space Suits:** Designed to sustain astronauts in Mars' harsh environment.
- **Pressurized Rover:** Provides mobility for astronauts during the mission.

## Challenges and Learnings

- **Mission Cost and Funding:** The estimated cost of 37.49 billion USD requires a diverse funding strategy. This includes seeking capital from **private investors** and **sponsors**, using **US governmental funds** for the remainder, and engaging the public through **crowdfunding**. A unique incentive proposed is a **100 million USD prize**, conceptually awarded to the crew upon successful ascent, with **all surplus funds raised pledged to charitable causes**, drawing inspiration from initiatives like the Inspiration4 mission.

- **Risk Assessment:** Includes vehicle malfunctions, astronaut health issues, and potential mission failure.
- **Mars Environmental Conditions:** The thin atmosphere, dust storms, and extreme temperatures pose significant challenges.
- **Crew Selection and Training:** The astronauts must endure rigorous physical and psychological training for the demanding mission.

## Outcome

The study concludes that a crewed ascent of Olympus Mons is feasible with appropriate technological advancements and financial backing. The mission plan emphasizes astronaut safety, sustainability, and scientific exploration. Further research is required to refine cost models, space vehicle designs, and risk mitigation strategies to ensure mission success.
