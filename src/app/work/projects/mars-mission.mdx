## Overview
The Olympus Mons Ascension Mission is a conceptual study exploring a crewed ascent of the tallest volcano in the Solar System. The mission is planned for 2043, with the goal of being the first human expedition to summit Olympus Mons. The project is divided into five main subgroups: Overall Coordination, Mission Design, Human Aspects, Mars Operations, and Space Vehicles. A budget of 37.49 billion USD has been estimated, with financial, logistical, and technical challenges addressed.

- **Risk Assessment:** Includes vehicle malfunctions, astronaut health issues, and potential mission failure.
- **Mars Environmental Conditions:** The thin atmosphere, dust storms, and extreme temperatures pose significant challenges.
- **Crew Selection and Training:** The astronauts must endure rigorous physical and psychological training for the demanding mission.

## Outcome

The study concludes that a crewed ascent of Olympus Mons is feasible with appropriate technological advancements and financial backing. The mission plan emphasizes astronaut safety, sustainability, and scientific exploration. Further research is required to refine cost models, space vehicle designs, and risk mitigation strategies to ensure mission success.
