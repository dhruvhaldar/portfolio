## Overview

Cycling in Stockholm is increasingly seen as a sustainable and efficient commuting option. However, barriers such as social perceptions, workplace infrastructure, and seasonal challenges prevent wider adoption. This project, conducted as part of Openlab’s master course, aims to develop strategies that encourage more people to bike to work by addressing these challenges and fostering a sense of community among cyclists.

## Key Features

- **Community Building:** Developing initiatives to unite cyclists and create a shared identity to influence workplace policies and urban planning.
- **Behavioral Insights:** Studying social and psychological factors affecting commuter decisions.
- **Infrastructure and Workplace Integration:** Evaluating current workplace facilities and proposing improvements.
- **Gamification and Social Engagement:** Introducing competitive and interactive elements to encourage participation.

## Technologies Used

- **Design Thinking Methodology:** Applied to understand challenges and prototype potential solutions.
- **Survey and Data Collection Tools:** Used to assess commuter behavior and workplace cycling policies.
- **Digital and Physical Prototyping:** Created concepts such as interactive cycling boards and gamified commuter tracking.

## Challenges and Learnings

- **Perception vs. Reality:** Many non-cyclists overestimate the difficulties of commuting by bike.
- **Workplace Facilities Gaps:** Many companies claim to be bike-friendly but lack functional infrastructure.
- **Social Influence:** Workplace culture and peer influence significantly impact commuting choices.
- **Weather and Safety Concerns:** Addressing fears about winter biking and road safety is crucial.

## Outcome

The project resulted in the development of several initiatives, including:
- **Commuter Board:** A digital and physical platform for workplace engagement, tracking, and social networking.
- **Cyclopath Navigation System:** A route-mapping tool showing estimated cycling times to encourage adoption.
- **CycloDash Game:** A competitive social game to motivate employees through rewards and recognition.
