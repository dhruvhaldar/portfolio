## Overview

The primary objective is to develop a framework to evaluate fuel consumption for different aircraft sizes and flight profiles. The study, based on MATLAB simulations, focuses on the Environmental Control System (ECS) and its electrification's effects on efficiency and weight impact.

## Key Features

- **Comparison of Conventional and Electric ECS:** Three configurations analyzedâ€”ACM, E-ACM, and E-VCM.
- **Passenger Scaling Impact:** Investigation of how varying passenger numbers affect fuel consumption.
- **Flight Profile Considerations:** Simulation of real-world scenarios, including round-trip flights between Copenhagen and Stockholm.
- **Subsystem Weight and Drag Analysis:** Effects of additional weight and induced drag on aircraft fuel efficiency.

# Technologies Used

- **MATLAB:** Development of numerical models for energy consumption and aircraft simulation.
- **Computational Aerodynamics:** Thrust and drag estimations based on flight conditions.
- **Heat Transfer Modelling:** ECS efficiency evaluation under varying environmental conditions.

# Challenges and Learnings

- **Balancing Efficiency and Weight:** The additional weight of electric ECS offsets some operational fuel efficiency gains.
- **Subsystem Interactions:** Dynamic interactions between aircraft subsystems affect overall energy consumption.
- **Optimizing ECS for Different Conditions:** Identifying the trade-offs between cooling, heating, and power requirements.

# Outcome

The study concludes that MEA technologies, specifically electrifying the ECS, can lead to fuel savings between 4% and 8%, depending on aircraft size and flight profile. Larger aircraft benefit more from electrification, and optimized ECS configurations provide improved operational efficiency. Future work includes expanding electrification to additional subsystems and refining the simulation model for broader applicability.
