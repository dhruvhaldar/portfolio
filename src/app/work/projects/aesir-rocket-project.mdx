## Overview

Established in 2019, the Sigmundr project was a student-led rocketry initiative by AESIR (Association of Engineering Students in Rocketry) at KTH (Kungliga Tekniska Högskolan i Stockholm).  The project involved the design, construction, launch, and recovery of a student-built rocket.  This was the second year of launches, following the previous year's Odin rocket launch, which, while successful in its initial flight, resulted in the loss of the rocket due to a failed recovery.

> The Sigmundr project aimed to improve upon the Odin project by focusing on reliable recovery and data acquisition.

## Key Features

- **Student-Designed and Built:** AESIR students were responsible for all aspects of the project.
- **Focus on Recovery:** A primary goal was to successfully recover the rocket.

## Technical Details

Here is a snippet of the flight data analysis logic:

```python
def calculate_altitude(pressure, sea_level_pressure):
    # Barometric formula
    return 44330 * (1 - (pressure / sea_level_pressure) ** (1/5.255))
```

## Outcome

The Sigmundr launch was a resounding success.
