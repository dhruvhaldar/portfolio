## Overview

This report presents an analysis for **Green Destruct AB**, a material destruction company, focusing on the efficient allocation of resources to minimize costs and maximize profits. The project utilizes **Linear Programming** implemented via GAMS to process data, constraints, and variables. The problem was divided into two main parts: the first addressed **deterministic constraints**, while the second considered the same constraints but with **demand modeled as a normal distribution**. The ultimate goal was to find optimal profit and resource allocation solutions.

## Problem Description

A wooden floorboard company generates approximately **31 tons of hazardous waste weekly** across its eight factories. Green Destruct AB is contracted to handle this waste, charging **250 kr per kilogram**. Green Destruct AB operates four destruction factories with specific capacities. They are also responsible for transportation, with costs at **1 kr per kilogram per kilometer up to 1800 kg**, and **1.45 kr per kilometer for every kilogram above 1800 kg**. Destruction costs are **120 kr per kilogram for waste up to 1800kg** and an estimated **100 kr per kilogram above 1800 kg** due to economies of scale. Distances between factories are also provided.

* **Part 1 Objective:** Minimize Green Destruct AB's costs by identifying ideal transportation routes and waste destruction locations for a fixed amount of waste.
* **Part 2 Objective:** Analyze the situation where waste amounts are uncertain and follow a **normal distribution with a 5% standard deviation**. The objective is to suggest changes, including potentially increasing plant capacities at a cost of **200 kr per kilogram extra capacity**, to handle fluctuations.

## Mathematical Formulation

The problem was formulated using variables such as `x_low` (shipment quantities for less than 1.8 tons) and `x_high` (shipment quantities for more than 1.8 tons). Destruction costs (`Clow`, `Chigh`) and transportation costs (`flow`, `fhigh`) were also defined per ton/kilo.

Key constraints include:
* **Destruction factory capacity constraints:** Total shipments to a destruction factory cannot exceed its capacity.
* **1.8-ton threshold:** Shipments are split into `x_low` (up to 1.8 tons) and `x_high` (excess above 1.8 tons).
* **Supply and Demand Equations:** Equations were formulated to represent the supply from production companies and demand at destruction factories.
* **Objective Function (Part 1):** Minimized total cost considering destruction, transportation, and pick-up fees.
* **Part 2 Additions:** An `c_excess` cost was introduced for exceeding capacity, and the demand constraint was modified to include `x_excess`. The objective function for Part 2 also incorporated `c_excess`.

## Results and Analysis

### Part 1: Deterministic Demand
* **Optimal Transportation Routes:** Table 5 illustrates the optimal transportation routes when no excess capacity is allowed.
* **Waste Allocation:** Arboga, Fagersta, and Nyköping destruction factories operate at maximum capacity, while Ludvika has one ton to spare.
* **Profit:** This allocation results in an optimal objective value of **-560,860 kr**, indicating a profit of **560,860 kr** for Green Destruct AB.

### Part 2: Uncertain Demand with Excess
* **Optimal Allocation with Excess:** When allowing for excessive production, the optimal allocation shifts.
* **Capacity Reallocation Recommendation:** Due to high transportation costs to Ludvika, it becomes more cost-effective to incur the higher destruction cost of exceeding capacity at Nyköping. A key recommendation is to **reallocate destruction capacity from Ludvika to Nyköping** if feasible.
* **Normal Distribution Analysis:** With a mean weekly waste production of 31 tons and a standard deviation of 1.55 (5% of 31), there is approximately a **26% probability** that demand will exceed the supply limit of 32 tons. Therefore, increasing destruction capacity is a reasonable recommendation.
* **Approximate Profit (Part 2):** The objective value for this model fluctuates around **-641,070 kr**, corresponding to an approximate profit of **641,070 kr**.

## Challenges and Model Limitations

While the results are considered reasonable and useful, the model has limitations:
* **Simplification of Reality:** The model is a simplification, especially regarding transportation costs, which are represented by two fixed costs but can vary significantly in real-world scenarios.
* **Lack of Contingency Planning:** The model does not account for potential breakdowns in transportation or factories, which would significantly impact costs and require alternative waste routing.

## Summary and Conclusion

Based on the analysis:
* In a deterministic demand scenario, Ludvika is the site with excess capacity.
* If excess capacity at factories is allowed, it is more efficient to allocate more waste destruction to Nyköping and less to Ludvika.
* When demand follows a normal distribution, there is a **26% risk that demand surpasses supply**. Despite increased destruction costs in this scenario, the company is still projected to make a profit.
