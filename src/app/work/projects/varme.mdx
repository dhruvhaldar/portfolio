## Conclusion

The best possible solution for the given problem comes out to be 3828.150 kkr, which is 0.350 kkr less than the total cost with mixed-integer programming. It is also observed that the cold starts are more than the warm starts, which proposes the notion that the model can be improved by increasing the cycle time period from 24 hours to a longer duration, so that the units are down only for one period i.e. warm-start.

Furthermore is a 24 hour cycle uncertain for the reason that the consumption of energy may differ between seasons. But the consumption could also differ between the days within a season. The cycle could therefore be improved from to a longer one, for instance to a year. If the demand is known for every hour of the day it might decrease the cost if the 24 hour cycle is divided into more time periods. That way the problem could be optimized with a higher accuracy.
