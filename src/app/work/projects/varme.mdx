> _The best possible solution for the given problem comes out to be 3828.150 kkr, which is 0.350 kkr less than the total cost with mixed-integer programming._

## Overview

The objective of this project was to minimize the cost of operating a power plant, Varme, over a 24-hour period. The plant consists of three power units, each with its own operational constraints, including initial startup costs, running costs, and downtime requirements. The problem was formulated as a mixed-integer programming (MIP) model to determine the optimal scheduling of units to meet varying demand across different time periods.

## Key Features

- **Demand-Based Optimization**: The model optimizes for a varying demand schedule across five periods: **50, 60, 80, 70, and 60 MW**.
- **Cost-Efficient Scheduling**: Minimizes costs by balancing running costs against **startup penalties** (50% higher cost if off for >1 period).
- **Unit Constraints Handling**: strict operational constraints, such as a **maximum runtime of three consecutive periods** before a mandatory rest.
- **Mathematical Formulation**: The problem is solved using a rigorous MIP approach to achieve the lowest possible cost.

## Technologies Used

- **GAMS Software**: Used for formulating and solving the mixed-integer programming model.
- **Mathematical Optimization**: Linear and integer programming techniques were employed to balance demand and costs.
- **Power Plant Data Analysis**: Historical energy consumption data was used to refine the model's accuracy.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the main challenges was ensuring that all constraints were correctly implemented while maintaining computational efficiency. Managing cold starts (where a unit has been turned off for multiple periods) proved to be critical, as these resulted in higher startup costs. Another key insight was that increasing the scheduling cycle from 24 hours to a longer duration could potentially reduce overall costs by minimizing cold starts.

## Outcome

The optimal solution yielded a total operational cost of **3828.5 kkr**. The solver (GAMS) produced a schedule where:

- **Unit 3** starts in Period 2.
- **Unit 2** starts in Period 3.
- **Unit 1** starts in Period 5.

This strategic staggering allowed the most efficient units to cover peak demand while adhering to the 3-period run limit. The analysis also suggested that extending the optimization horizon beyond 24 hours could reduce "cold start" penalties, further lowering costs.
