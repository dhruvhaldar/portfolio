## Overview

This study investigates the impact of More Electric Aircraft (MEA) technologies on Wing Ice Protection Systems (WIPS). The research aims to assess fuel and power consumption under different icing conditions and compare the performance of conventional pneumatic WIPS (p-WIPS) and electrothermal WIPS (e-WIPS). A simulation framework was developed to analyze the mass of ice formed on an Airbus A320 wing subjected to in-flight icing conditions during climb and descent phases.

## Key Features

- **In-Flight Icing Analysis**: Simulates ice formation and accumulation using atmospheric conditions compliant with aviation standards.

- **Electrothermal vs Pneumatic WIPS Comparison**: Evaluates the power and fuel savings achieved by replacing conventional p-WIPS with e-WIPS.

- **Simulation-Based Approach**: Utilizes FENSAP-ICE for ice accretion modeling and ANSYS for thermodynamic analysis.

- **Regulatory Compliance*: Adheres to EASA CS-25 Appendix C icing conditions for accurate validation.

## Technologies Used

- **FENSAP-ICE**: For simulating in-flight icing conditions and analyzing droplet behavior.
- **ANSYS SpaceClaim & Fluent**: For designing and simulating airflow and heat transfer in WIPS.
- **MATLAB**: For automating geometry generation and pre-processing airfoil parameters.
- **Python & IronPython**: For automating workflows within ANSYS and integrating simulation processes.


## Challenges and Learnings

The study encountered challenges in accurately simulating ice accretion on aircraft wings, particularly in capturing transient heat transfer phenomena. Additionally, balancing computational efficiency with high-fidelity icing models required optimization of meshing strategies. One key finding was that electrothermal WIPS can achieve up to 50% power savings compared to conventional pneumatic systems, depending on icing severity and flight phase.

## Outcome

The results demonstrated that e-WIPS significantly reduces power consumption, with an estimated savings of **13%** to **50%** compared to p-WIPS. The total power utilization for e-WIPS was **42.23 kW for climb** and **43.2 kW for descent**, leading to reduced fuel consumption. The study validates the potential of MEA technologies to improve aircraft efficiency and reduce emissions, aligning with the aviation industry's 2050 sustainability goals.
