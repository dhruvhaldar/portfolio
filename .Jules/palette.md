## 2025-05-15 - Select Component Display Value Mismatch
**Learning:** The `Select` component was displaying the internal `value` (ID) in the trigger input instead of the user-facing `label`. This is a common pattern failure where reusing a generic `Input` component (which expects value=display) for a Select trigger (where value!=display) causes UX friction (users see "us-east-1" instead of "US East").
**Action:** Always verify that "Select" or "Combobox" components compute a dedicated `displayValue` derived from the selected option's label, separate from the form submission `value`.
